# FriendFinder
Welcome to Friend Finder! This page here will document all that this app is about. 

Purpose: This app wil take your responses and compare them to other memebers in our database. Those with the most similar responses will be paired up with you and you will recieve one way to contact them. 
How it works: You must put down a name and a way to contact. Then there are ten questions with five drop-down options to choose from. You do have the option to leave a question blank. After pressing submit, you will get an alert to say with whom you are matched up with. 

Things that work well in this version of the app: 
-npm packages, gitignore, and other packages are used correctly. 
-You can travel between pages easily. 

Things that need to be worked on: 
-The logic for finding your pairing needs to be fixed. Right now, you are being paired with yourself. And though you should always be your best friend first, that is not quite the point of this application.
-Not all the 'js' pages have been used to its max efficency.
